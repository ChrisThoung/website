# Some thoughts on macroeconomic input-output modelling in Python

**This is work-in-progress code.** I'm still finalising this initial version
and will also change the name/location of this sub-folder once I have an
accompanying write-up.

Experimental code for a possible implementation of a macroeconomic input-output
model in Python, using similar principles to
[FSIC](https://github.com/ChrisThoung/fsic), my Python package for (aggregate)
economic modelling. As experimental code, *this is nowhere close to a complete
and operational macroeconomic model*, but is instead a testbed for a possible
implementation.

The example uses 12-industry Scottish Government input-output tables
('Aggregate tables 1998 to 2017': SUT-Agg-98-17.xlsx) available from:  
[https://www.gov.scot/publications/input-output-latest/](https://www.gov.scot/publications/input-output-latest/)

You'll need to download the data and then run a Python script (see instructions
below) to process the data to a useable format.

## Instructions

1. Download the 12-industry input-output tables ('Aggregate tables 1998 to
   2017': SUT-Agg-98-17.xlsx) from the Scottish Government website, saving to
   this folder:  
   [https://www.gov.scot/publications/input-output-latest/](https://www.gov.scot/publications/input-output-latest/)
2. Run process_raw_data.py (e.g. `python process_raw_data.py`) to generate a
   data file, data.txt, from the raw Scottish Government data
3. Run example_model.py (e.g. `python example_model.py`) to test the example
   model, which just implements the calculation for gross output using a vector
   of final demands and the (Type I) Leontief Inverse matrix. If this
   calculation runs through without error, the model/'model' has successfully
   reproduced the gross output figures in the original data. The script then
   runs a (very) simple scenario of higher government spending for comparison,
   and to show how to use the object's container methods.
